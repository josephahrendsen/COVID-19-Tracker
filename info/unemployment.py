COVID-19 has taken its effect on our nationâ€™s economy and is resulting in many Americans losing their jobs and filing for unemployment. In the three weeks leading up to April, over 17 million Americans filed for unemployment. Due to this, congress has passed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package which provides extra payment to those unemployed for the first four months. This will try to help those in need get by until the virus dies down."),
    html.P("Most states by now have initiated a Stay-At-Home order, which requires all residents to stay isolated at their houses except for necessary shopping like groceries and people with essential jobs. While these essential workers are not having to file for unemployment, they are exposing themselves to potentially getting the virus and helping it spread. It is extremely difficult for the government to find a balance between keeping its citizens safe and keeping the economy from crashing. If no one was an essential worker, then there would be no internal cashflow which could send us into a depression, and if everyone was allowed to travel freely, the majority of the public would put at risk. Until the virus stops spreading, our nation will continue to struggle, so the best thing anyone can do is practice social distancing and follow the instructions provided by your state and federal government.
