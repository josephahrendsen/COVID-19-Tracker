# COVID-19-Tracker
### What is it
COVID-19 Tracker provides a graphical interface for visualizing the trends in the Novel Coronavirus. 

### Inspiration
In March, the United States took the title for the largest number of COVID-19 cases of any country in the world. As we continued to see cases spike, 
it was clear this was going to be a problem for a very long time. To help people understand where the largest outbreaks were in the country, we created the COVID-19 Tracker.
It shows data all the way down to a county level because we wanted people to see how the virus has affected their own communities.  

### What we used
The app was built using Python. We utilized the Python Dash framework and Plotly library to create informative, interactive graphs. 
For our data, we used the John Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset that is updated daily.

### How to use it
At this point, you have to manuallly update the data from the John Hopkins github by downloading the most recent files. I am working on a way to automate this.
